The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has produced several global climate predictions based on five greenhouse gas emission scenarios that account for future emission levels, mitigation measures, and uncertainities in the model projections.

The intermediate-emissions scenario projected a rise of between 2.1 and 3.5\u00b0C (3.8 and 6.3\u00b0F) by 2100, while the highest-emissions scenario predicted an increase of between 4.7 and 9.2\u00b0C (9.9 and 16.5\u00b0F) by 2100.",

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has produced several global climate predictions based on five greenhouse gas emission scenarios that account for future emission levels, mitigation measures, and uncertainities in the model projection. The lowest-emissions scenario predicted a rise of between 1.0\u00b0C (1.8\u00b0F) and 1.8\u00b0C (3.2\u00b0F) by 2100, while the highest-emissions scenario projected an increase of between 3.3\u00b0C (5.9\u00b0F) and 5.7\u00b0C (10.2\u00b0F) by 2100 based on the assumption that greenhouse gas emission levels would continue to increase throughout the 21st century. The intermediate-emissions scenario projected a rise of between 2.1\u00b0C (3.8\u00b0F) and 3.5\u00b0C (6.3\u00b0F) by 2100, while the highest-emissions scenario predicted an increase of between 4.7\u00b0C (9.9\u00b0F) and 9.2\u00b0C (16.5\u00b0F) by 2100.\n\nBased on these global climate predictions, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has recommended that action be taken to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and reduce global warming. The next steps include reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 45% below 1990 levels by 2030, and achieving net-zero emissions by mid-century. This will require significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from all sectors of the economy, including transportation, buildings, industry, and agriculture. The adoption of clean energy technologies, such as renewable energy sources like wind and solar power, and the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies to remove CO2 from the atmosphere will also be necessary to achieve net-zero emissions.\n\nIn conclusion, global warming is a pressing issue that requires immediate action to mitigate its effects on the environment and human health. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has produced several global climate predictions based on five greenhouse gas emission scenarios, and the lowest-emissions scenario predicted a rise of between 1.0\u00b0C (1.8\u00b0F) and 1.8\u00b0C (3.2\u00b0F) by 2100, while the highest-emissions scenario projected an increase of between 3.3\u00b0C (5.9\u00b0F) and 5.7\u00b0C (10.2\u00b0F) by 2100 based on the assumption that greenhouse gas emission levels would continue to increase throughout the 21st century.
