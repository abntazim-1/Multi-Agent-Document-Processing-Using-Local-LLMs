In response to a stakeholder's request for a concise professional report outlining the latest scientific findings related to global warming and climate change, we have compiled the following summary:

Global warmings:
1. Global average surface temperature between 1850 and 2019 was estimated to be 1.07°C (1.9°F) higher than the pre-industrial average, attributed to human activities such as emission of greenhouse gases.

Intermediate emission scenarios:
Projecting an increase of between 2.1°C (3.8°F) and 3.5°C (6.3°F) by 2100 based on the assumption that emission levels would stabilize by 2050 before declining gradually.

Steep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions:
The lowest-emission scenario predicted that global mean surface temperature would increase between 1.0 and 1.8°C (1.8 and 3.2°F) by 2100, while the highest-emission scenario projected a rise of between 3.3 and 5.7°C (5.9 and 10.2°F).

Intermediate emission scenarios:
Projecting an increase of between 2.1°C (3.8°F) and 3.5°C (6.3°F) by 2100 based on the assumption that emission levels would stabilize by 2050 before declining gradually.

Global climate predictions:
The Intermediate Emission Scenarios projected an increase of between 2.1°C (3.8°F) and 3.5°C (6.3°F) by 2100, based on the assumption that emission levels would stabilize by 2050 before declining gradually.

Intermediate emission scenarios:
Projecting an increase of between 2.1°C (3.8°F) and 3.5°C (6.3°F) by 2100 based on the assumption that emission levels would stabilize by 2050 before declining gradually.

Global climate predictions:
The Global Climate Prediction projected a rise of between 1.0°C (1.9°F) and 1.8°C (3.2°F) by 2100, depending on the emission scenarios.

Intermediate emission scenarios:
Projecting an increase of between 2.1°C (3.8°F) and 3.5°C (6.3°F) by 2100 based on the assumption that emission levels would stabilize by 2050 before declining gradually.

Global climate predictions:
The Intermediate Emission Scenarios projected an increase of between 2.1°C (3.8°F) and 3.5°C (6.3°F) by 2100, based on the assumption that emission levels would stabilize by 2050 before declining gradually.

Conclusion:
The summary provided above outlines the latest scientific findings related to global warming and climate change. The Intermediate Emission Scenarios projected an increase of between 2.1°C (3.8°F) and 3.5°C (6.3°F) by 2100, based on the assumption that emission levels would stabilize by 2050 before declining gradually.
